# Boost Accumulators

---

# What is the Boost Accumulators Library?

Provides powerful wrappers for performing real-time statistical operations on datasets.

## What Type of Operations?

* Min, Max, Count
* Mean, Median, Mode
* Variance
* Density, Moments, Tails

---

# Boost Accumulators

* Header-only library
* Heavily utilizes Boost Meta-Programming Library
* All `accumulators` are either $O(1)$ or $O(N)$ with N as a fixed number (ex: number bins in CDF).

---

#  What is this good for?

This demo is focused on using this library, which wraps Boost Accumulators, to enable useful troubleshooting and debugging of systems which are difficult to profile.

* Often, we have performance-constraints which prevent building with debugging symbols.
* There can be bugs which occur infrequently, thus its difficult to find patterns.
  * __ex:__ Blocking due to muxes or other race conditions.
* There can be extensive noise in the data, making it difficult to find trends.
  * __ex:__ Measuring compression ratios of imagery algorithms.
  * __ex:__ Functions working on many threads at once.
* The problem grows slowly, making it difficult to identify the problem in the first place.
  * __ex:__  Memory leaks and algorithms with $O(n^2)$ performance.

---

# What is this not good for?

* This will __never__ beat the power using `awk`, `sed`, and `grep` on log files.  It's just faster and better for __real-time__ logging.
* It won't beat a profiler or debugger.  This is designed for cases where we can't use either effectively.

# Simple Example

1. Determine the features you want to use

``` cpp
// A solid "general-purpose" feature set
typedef boost::accumulators::stats<boost::accumulators::tag::mean,
                                   boost::accumulators::tag::min,
                                   boost::accumulators::tag::max,
                                   boost::accumulators::tag::sum,
                                   boost::accumulators::tag::count,
                                   boost::accumulators::tag::variance> FEATURE_SET;
```

2.  Build the `accumulator_set` object.

``` cpp
boost::accumulators::accumulator_set<double,FEATURE_SET> acc;
```

3.  Add data to the `accumulator_set`.

``` cpp
acc( some_value );
```

---
# Simple Example


4. Query specific values
``` cpp
double mean   = boost::accumulators::mean( acc );
double stddev = std::sqrt( boost::accumulators::variance( acc ) );
double min    = boost::accumulators::min( acc );
double max    = boost::accumulators::max( acc );
```

##  Tips for using Boost Accumulators

1. Always wrap code with classes to ease copy-paste.
2. Use `typedefs` and namespaces to simplify your logic.
    * Don't be tempted to use `using namespace boost::accumulators`. ___BAD___!

3. Create print functions to standardize output.
4. Recommend printing in a log-friendly or analysis-friendly way
    * Use space-deliminated patterns with a logger that prints timestamps if using with `awk`,`grep`, `select-string` or other shell tools.
    * For Python analysis, write as JSON or use Boost `property_tree` for output.
5. Don't over-complicate your wrapper code unless you are comfortable with templates.

---
## A Few Notes About Template Meta-Programming in C++

* Don't do it unless you are __confident__ with C++ and have a __high__ tolerance for pain.

* It can cause ___incredible___ pain and suffering:
    * It creates vague and useless compilation errors.  Botched recusion in templates can create thousands of lines of replicated errors.
    * Templates don't get compiled until you _instanciate_ an object with the given template parameters.  You may go 5 years without knowing it fails on `uint8_t` but passes with an `int8_t`.
    * IDEs are utterly useless for doing anything once you create a template.
    * Once you start creating `typedef`, you tend to create dozens more.
    * You will inevitably forget to wrap a template in a namespace or call `using namespace <>` and re-learn why that's bad.

---

## A Few Notes About Template Meta-Programming in C++

* It can do incredible things
    * Enforce extreme type safety.  Stop using `double` and create `mass` or `weight` types..
    https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_82_0/libs/mpl/doc/tutorial/tutorial-metafunctions.html
    * You can force the compiler to solve problems for you: (Fibonacci example)
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/908256/getting-template-metaprogramming-compile-time-constants-at-runtime
    * You can statically bind vtables for extra performance in Polymorphic classes.
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern

## `lib-accumulator`

Simple wrapper around Boost Accumulators

* `Accumulator` class for managing features and printing output.
* `Stopwatch` class for easier timing.



---

## Demo 1 : Using Boost Accumulators directly to track runtime performance.

example: `src/demo1.cpp`

* Imagine a function that does a lot of work and it repeated many times.
``` cpp
// Do a big loop
for( size_t i=0; i < number_iterations; i++ )
{
    // Get the start time
    auto start_time = std::chrono::steady_clock::now();

    Do_Complex_Task();

    // Compute task time
    auto operation_time = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(std::chrono::steady_clock::now() - start_time);
    acc_worker( operation_time.count() );
}
```

* Notes:
    * This accumulator call is often faster than logging due to no string-building.
    * You add 2-3 lines of instrumentation code for a specific region.
    * This runs in `Release` or `Debug` builds.  No need to profile.

---

## Demo 1 : Using Accumulators to track runtime performance.

* Create a print function which wraps all of the relevant calls
``` cpp
std::string print_accumulator( const boost::accumulators::accumulator_set<double,FEATURE_SET>& acc,
                               const std::string&                                              units )
{
    std::string gap( 4, ' ' );
    std::stringstream sout;

    // Recommend setting precision for when you print doubles.
    sout << std::setprecision(4);
    sout << std::fixed;

    sout << gap << "Count : " << boost::accumulators::count( acc ) << " entries" << std::endl;
    sout << gap << "Mean  : " << boost::accumulators::mean( acc ) << " " << units << std::endl;
    sout << gap << "Min   : " << boost::accumulators::min( acc ) << " " << units << std::endl;
    sout << gap << "Max   : " << boost::accumulators::max( acc ) << " " << units << std::endl;
    sout << gap << "StdDev: " << std::sqrt( boost::accumulators::variance( acc ) ) << " " << units << std::endl;
    sout << gap << "Sum   : " << boost::accumulators::sum( acc ) << " " << units << std::endl;

    return sout.str();
}
```

## Demo 1 Results

``` bash
Final Results After 1000 Iterations
    Count : 1000 entries
    Mean  : 102.5610 ms
    Min   : 90.0000 ms
    Max   : 115.0000 ms
    StdDev: 6.0851 ms
    Sum   : 102561.0000 ms
```

### What does this tell us?

1. Mean is 102 ms with a small Standard-Deviation.  This method is very consistent.
2. __Min__ and __max__ are relatively close to __mean__, so no random noisy results.
3. A total of 102 seconds was spent in this function for the duration of the loop.

### What does this tell us?

``` bash
Final Results After 1000 Iterations
    Count : 1000 entries
    Mean  : 102.5610 ms
    Min   : 0.1020 ms
    Max   : 300.0000 ms
    StdDev: 24.0851 ms
    Sum   : 82561.0000 ms
```

1. Mean is 102 ms with a relatively large Standard-Deviation.
    * This method has inconsistent performance.
2. __Min__ is ___effectively___ zero.  You may have an edge case or something not working properly, causing immediate returns.
3. __Max__ is 3x the mean for what was previously a very tight result.
    * Look for deadlocks, resource starvation, or other multi-threading woes.
    * If max is considerably far from the mean than the min, you likely have a deadlock.  Algorithms typically have a fairly centered mean wrt __min/mean/max__.

## Demo 2 - Analyzing Compression Performance

In this very lazy example, a batch of random images are created and written to disk.  The compressed image and expected raw image are compared.  Timing info is also tracked. Multiple image formats are considered.


1. Create Accumulators

``` cpp
auto timing_acc      = acc::Accumulator<acc::FULL_FEATURE_SET,double>::create( "ms" );
auto compression_acc = acc::Accumulator<acc::FULL_FEATURE_SET,double>::create( "%" );
```

2. Dispatch Threads

``` cpp
{
    Thread_Pool pool( max_threads );
    pool.init();

    std::deque<std::future<void>> jobs;
    for( size_t worker = 0; worker < number_images; worker++ )
    {
        // See Next Slide
    }

    for( auto& job : jobs ){ job.get(); }
    pool.shutdown();
}
```
---
## Demo 2 - Analyzing Compression Performance

3. Measure compression time
``` cpp
jobs.push_back( pool.submit([=, &timing_acc, &compression_acc, &format ]() {
                int id = worker;

                acc::Stopwatch<> timer;
                Compress_Imagery( id,
                                  image_size,
                                  output_dir,
                                  compression_acc,
                                  format );
                timing_acc.insert( (double)timer.stop().count() );
            }));
```

---
## Demo 2 - Analyzing Compression Performance

3. Measure compression rate
``` cpp
// 1. Create Image
// 2. Get expected image size (uncompressed)
const size_t expected_size = img_size.width * img_size.height * 3;

// 3. Create output image path
// 4. Build image
// 5. Smooth with median filter to more realistically simulate noise
// 6. Write image

// 7. Compute compression percentage
double file_ratio = std::filesystem::file_size( output_path ) / (double)expected_size;
comp_acc.insert( file_ratio * 100 );

```

## Demo 2 - Analyzing Compression Performance

* This demo was designed to be as brutal as possible on compression algorithms.
* JPEG is clearly the highest performer. JPEG gives impressive results at consistent timing.
* TIF gives okay results with LZW with very efficient timing.
* PNG has consistent results, but wildly different timing.

### Demo 3 - Finding bugs in noisy or complex environments

This demo shows a degrading algorithm.  This is common in programming.
* Memory leaks can cause performance loss as you run out of RAM.
* Poorly written algorithms can degrade as $O(N^2)$ or worse operations take their toll.

This demo also shows how to spot random failures using rolling windows.
* What happens when the results are too noisy for casual observation, but still growing?
* Deadlocks and race conditions create situations where you can experience infrequent "blackouts" with relatively stable normal operation.

---
### Demo 3 - Notes

* This only matters if you are dealing with code that can't easily run in a profiler, debugger, or other normal toolchain.

* This demo uses a comically-bad set of data structures to store increasingly large amounts of data.

* Previous demos showed log output in a "pretty" format.  This demo shows log output in a "shell-friendly" format.
   * `include/lib-acc/Pretty_Printer.hpp`
   * `include/lib-acc/Shell_Printer.hpp`
   * No reason you can't use Boost `property_tree` to write JSON or XML either.

See `demo3.cpp` for implementation.

---
### Demo 3 Results

This "shell-friendly" format uses space-deliminated tokens which can be easily parsed by `awk` or `python`.  This makes it easier to plot results.

# Summary

* Boost Accumulators can be useful in situations where Heisenbugs limit the efficacy of standard programming troubleshooting tools.
* This library can use a lot of additional work to make better
  * Implement a rolling __min/max__ for a specific window size.
  * Allow inserting `std::chrono::duration` objects directly using `std::enable_if`.
  * Use `boost::mpl::map` to bind `boost::accumulators::features` and `boost::accumulators::tag` for less copy/paste in the `Accumulator` class.
